        "quote": "The earliest manuscript proving the existence of Roman Emperor Julius Caesar, a copy of one of his works, dates from the ninth century A.D.  Caesar was stabbed to death in 44 B.C.  So approximately nine hundred years separate the life of Caesar from the first tangible, physical, paper copy of one of his written works. The earliest manuscript describing Caesar, but not written by him, dates from after the ninth century, and so is even more removed from the man it describes. None of this means that Julius Caesar did not exist or that he did not compose the works attributed to him. First century B.C. Roman coins prove, unequivocally, that Julius Caesar existed. No Roman coins prove the existence of today’s martyrs. Instead, something thousands of times larger than a coin proves they existed. There’s a church. In fact, there are two churches in Rome dedicated to Saints Nereus and Achilleus. These churches are not hard to find. You can touch their walls, open their doors, and sit in their pews. There is not one structure, much less two, in Rome or anywhere else, dedicated to Julius Caesar. Even the exact location of his assassination is a matter of conjecture. Almost nothing can be said with certainty regarding the lives and deaths of Nereus and Achilleus. There are conflicting traditions of when they lived, where they lived, and how they died. But…there are those churches. Two of them. In Rome. One is a fourth-century Basilica inside the ancient Catacombs of Domitilla. The other, from the sixth century, was built on the site where an early Christian tradition says Saint Peter encountered Christ as the Prince of the Apostles was abandoning Rome. A stone is a valuable form of testimony. It is more permanent than paper. A stone doesn’t easily deteriorate. A stone is heavy and remains where its builder placed it. Its location itself provides important clues. The stones of the two Roman churches dedicated to today’s saints give powerful, if silent, testimony. The churches are planted in the earth like giant gravestones telling who can be found in or beneath them. Who would assume that the words etched into a gravestone were a lie? Who would think that a name carved into granite described no one? Who would imagine that the ground under a memorial was empty, holding no grave, no casket, no body? Only a fool would believe such things. But Christians are no fools. An enormous death memorial, in the form of a church, was built by dedicated Christians in the fourth century in honor of today’s saints. Nereus and Achilleus were likely soldiers who were executed for their belief in Jesus Christ. An official list of Roman martyrs from the fifth-century names, specifically, Nereus and Achilleus, and states, specifically, that they are buried in the Catacombs of St. Domitilla. Pope Saint Gregory the Great, who reigned from 590–604, gave a homily, duly recorded and preserved, at the very tomb of Saints Nereus and Achilleus: “These saints before whose tomb we are assembled, despised the world and trampled it under their feet…” And more than one medieval manuscript records an ancient dedication to Nereus and Achilleus by Pope Damasus (366–384) attesting to their martyrdom for refusing to carry out military orders to kill Christians. The relics of today’s saints were transferred from their ancient underground Basilica in the catacombs to their “new” Church sometime in the sixth century. By the ninth century, the Basilica had been forgotten as wave after wave of invasion and plague and sack and turmoil decimated the Eternal City until it was a shadow of its imperial glory. But in 1874, a pioneering archaeologist named Giovanni de Rossi began excavating the Catacombs of Domitilla.  In the ruins of a subterranean Basilica there, he found two pillars, one of which had the name “Achilleus” carved into it. De Rossi also discovered chunks of the very marble slab bearing the dedication of Pope Damasus to Nereus and Achilleus! This discovery proved the medieval manuscripts describing the dedication were accurate. The stones spoke. The faithful listened. The traditions are true. The Church preserved its sacred history, and today the great tradition of honoring those who shed their blood for Christ perdures. Saints Nereus and Achilleus, we know little about you, except the most important things—that you lived, that you converted, and that you chose to not continue living rather than to deny your belief in Christ. We know these things, and they are enough. Pray for us.Little is known about Saints Nereus and Achilleus but we know is engraved in stone. Damasus, one of the first popes and later a saint himself, wrote the epitaph for the tombstone of Saints Nereus and Achilleus.   In this epitaph he proclaimed that it was love for Christ and a desire to witness to their new faith that inspired Nereus and Achilleus to “throw away their shields, their armour and their bloody spears.” It seems that both men were Roman soldiers who obeyed orders in the persecution of Christians until they themselves were converted to Christianity.   Because Christians were not allowed to bear arms, they resigned from the emperor’s army and escaped from Rome.   Eventually Nereus and Achilleus were captured and were removed to the island of Terracina, where they were martyred.   Their bodies were buried in a family vault, later known as the cemetery of Domitilla.      They were among the first martyrs to be venerated as saints.   Excavations by De Rossi in 1896 resulted in the discovery of their empty tomb in the underground church built by Pope Siricius in 390. Two hundred years after their deaths, St Pope Gregory the Great  (540-604)  Doctor of the Church, delivered his 28th homily on the occasion of their feast.   “These saints, before whom we are assembled, despised the world and trampled it under their feet when peace, riches and health gave it charms.” “O miracle of faith!” wrote Damasus. “Suddenly they cease from their fury, they become converted, they flee from the camp of their wicked leader.   Professing the faith of Christ, they are happy to witness to its triumph.   Learn from the words of Damasus what great things the glory of Christ can accomplish.”",
        "prayer": "Saints Achilleus and Nereus, pray for those in the military and armed forces throughout the world that they may always see God as their authority and obey God's orders first. Amen.",

        "quote": "“Take care above all things, most honoured lady, not to insult God’s boundless loving kindness, you would certainly do this, if you mourned as dead, one living face-to-face with God, one whose prayers, can bring you in your troubles, more powerful aid, than they ever could on earth.”",
        "prayer": "Venerable old age is not that of long time, nor counted by the number of years: but the understanding of man is grey hairs; and a spotless life is old age (Wisd. iv. 8, 9). And therefore, Aloysius, thou dost hold a place of honour, amidst the ancients of thy people! Glory be to the holy Society, in the midst whereof, thou didst, in so short a space, fulfill a long course; obtain that she may ever continue to treasure, both for herself and others, the teaching that flows from thy life of innocency and love. Holiness is the one only thing when one's career is ended, that can be called true again; and holiness is acquired from within. External works count with God, only in as far as the interior breath that inspires them is pure; if occasion for exercising works be wanting, man can always supply that deficiency, by drawing nigh unto the Lord, in the secret of his soul, as much and even more than he could have done by their means. Thus didst thou see and understand the question; and therefore, prayer, which held thee absorbed in its ineffable delights, succeeded in making thee equal to the very martyrs. What a priceless treasure was not prayer in thine eyes, what a heaven-lent boon, and one that is indeed in our reach too, just as it was in thine! But in order to find therein, as thou didst express it, \"the short cut to perfection,\" perseverance is needed and a careful elimination from the soul, by a generous self-repression, of every emotion which is not of God. For, how could muddy or troubled waters mirror forth the image of Him Who stands on their brink? Even so, a soul that is sullied, or a soul that without being quite a slave of passion, is not yet mistress of every earthly perturbation, can never reach the object of prayer, which is to reproduce within her the tranquil image of her God. The reproduction of the one great Model was perfect in thee; and hence it can be seen how nature (as regards what she has of good), far from losing or suffering aught, rather gains by this process of recasting in the divine crucible. Even in what touches the most legitimate affections, thou didst look at things no longer from the earthly point of view; but beholding all in God, far were the things of sense transcended, with all their deceptive feebleness, and wondrously did thy love grow in consequence! For instance, what could be more touching than thy sweet attentions, not only upon earth, but even from thy throne in heaven, for that admirable woman given thee by our Lord to be thine earthly mother? Where may tenderness be found equal to the affectionate effusions written to her by thee in that letter of a Saint to the mother of a Saint, which thou didst address to her shortly before thy quitting thine earthly pilgrimage? And still more, what exquisite delicacy thou didst evince, in making her the recipient of thy first miracle, worked after thine entrance into glory! Furthermore, the Holy Ghost, by setting thee on fire with the flame of divine charity, developed also within thee immense love for thy neighbour: necessarily so, because charity is essentially one; and well was this proved, when thou wast seen sacrificing thy life so blithely for the sick and the pestiferous. Cease not, O dearest Saint, to aid us in the midst of so many miseries; lend a kindly hand to each and all. Christian youth has a special claim upon thy patronage, for it is by the sovereign pontiff himself, that this precious portion of the flock is gathered around thy throne. Direct their feeble steps along the right path, so often enticed as they are to turn into dangerous by-roads; be prayer and earnest toil, for God's dear sake, their stay and safeguard; be they illumined in the serious matter before them of the choosing a state of life. We beseech thee, dearest Saint, exert strong influence over them during this most critical period of their opening years, so that they may truly experience all the potency of that fair privilege which is ever thine, of preserving in thy devout clients, the angelical virtue! Yea, furthermore, Aloysius, look compassionately on those who have not imitated thine innocence, and obtain that they may yet follow thee in the example of thy penance; such is the petition of Holy Church this day!",

My LORD Jesus Christ, Who because of Your love for men remain night and day in the Blessed Sacrament, full of pity and of love, awaiting, calling and welcoming all who come to visit You, I believe that You are present here on the altar. I adore You, and I thank You for all the graces You have bestowed on me, especially for having given me Yourself in this Sacrament, for having given me Your most holy Mother Mary to plead for me, and for having called me to visit You in this church. I now salute Your most loving Heart, and that for three ends: first, in thanksgiving for this great gift; secondly, to make amends to You for all the outrages committed against You in this Sacrament by Your enemies; thirdly, I intend by this visit to adore You in all the places on earth in which You are present in the Blessed Sacrament and in which You are least honored and most abandoned. My Jesus, I love You with my whole heart. I am very sorry for having so many times offended Your infinite goodness. With the help of Your grace, I purpose never to offend You again. And now, unworthy though I am, I consecrate myself to You without reserve. I renounce and give entirely to You my will, my affection, my desires and all that I possess. For the future, dispose of me and all I have as You please. All I ask of You is Your holy love, final perseverance and that I may carry out Your will perfectly. I recommend to You the souls in Purgatory, especially those who had the greatest devotion to the Blessed Sacrament and to the Blessed Virgin Mary. I also recommend to You all poor sinners. Finally, my dear Saviour, I unite all my desires with the desires of Your most loving Heart; and I offer them, thus united, to the Eternal Father, and beseech Him, in Your name and for love of You, to accept and grant them. St. Alphonsus Liguori was known as a tireless champion of our faith, both as a preacher and a prolific author of over 100 theological works that have since been translated into over 60 languages! His poignant prayers for the Stations of the Cross are still used in services, especially during Lent. This prayer, which truly reflects this great saint’s devotion to our Lord, comes from his first book, published in 1745, entitled Visits to the Blessed Sacrament. It is still in print today, along with his other classics like The Glories of Mary, a stirring and highly informative series of essays and meditations devoted to our Blessed Mother.",

And yet I have had the courage to drive You away from my soul on so many occasions!  You do not despise a humble and contrite heart.  You became human for my sake.  You died for me.  You even went so far as to become my food.  What more can there remain for You to do in order to gain my love?  Oh, that I could die with grief every time that I remember that I have despised Your grace.  I repent, O my love, with my whole heart for having offended you.  I love You, O infinite goodness!  I love You, O infinite love! I desire nothing but to love You, and I fear nothing but to live without your love.  My beloved Jesus, do not refuse to come to me.  Come, because I would rather die a thousand times than drive You away again.  I will do all that I can to please You.  Come and inflame my whole soul with Your love.  Grant that I may forget everything, to think only of You, and to desire You alone, my sovereign and my only good. Prayer composed by St. Alphonsus Liguori",

        "prayer": "In a word, the Three Persons of the Most Holy Trinity have endeavoured to show the love which God has borne us, that we may love him through gratitude.  It is, then, but just that we love that God who has been the first to love us, and to put us under so many obligations by so many proofs of tender love. “Let us, therefore, love God, because God first hath loved us.\" (1 John iv. 19.) Oh! what a treasure is charity! it is an infinite treasure, because it makes us partakers of the friendship of God. ”She is an infinite treasure to men, which they that use become the friends of God.\" (Wis. vii. 14.) But, to acquire this treasure, it is necessary to detach the heart from earthly things. “Detach the heart from creatures,\" says St. Teresa, \"and you shall find God.\" In a heart filled with earthly affections, there is no room for divine love. Let us therefore continually implore the Lord in our prayers, communions, and visits to the blessed sacrament, to give us his holy love; for this love will expel from our souls all affections for the things of this earth. ”When,\" says St. Francis de Sales, ”a house is on fire, all that is within is thrown out through the windows.\" By these words the saint meant, that when a soul is inflamed with divine love, s/he easily detaches him/herself from creatures: and Father Paul Segneri, the younger, used to say, that divine love is a thief that robs us of all earthly affections, and makes us exclaim: ”What, O my Lord, but thee alone, do I desire ?\"",

(by St. Alphonsus Liguori) My God, prostrate in Thy presence, I adore Thee; and I intend to make the following protestation, as if I were on the point of passing from this life into eternity. My Lord, because Thou art the infallible Truth, and hast revealed it to the holy Church, I believe in the mystery of the Most Holy Trinity, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, Three Persons, but only one God; Who for all eternity rewards the just in heaven, and punishes the wicked in hell. I believe that the Second Person, that is the Son of God, became man and died for the salvation of mankind; and I believe all that the holy Church believes. I thank Thee for having made me a Christian, and I protest that I will live and die in this holy faith. My God, my hope, trusting in Thy promises I hope from Thy mercy, not through my own merits, but through the merits of Jesus Christ, for the pardon of my sins, perseverance, and after this miserable life, the glory of paradise. And should the devil at death tempt me to despair at the sight of my sins, I protest that I will always hope in Thee, O Lord, and that I desire to die in the loving arms of Thy goodness. O God, worthy of infinite love, I love Thee with my whole heart, more than I love myself; and I protest that I desire to die making an act of love, that I may thus continue to love Thee eternally in heaven, which for this end I desire and ask of Thee. And if hitherto, O Lord, instead of loving Thee, I have despised Thy infinite goodness, I repent of it with all my heart, and I protest that I wish to die always weeping over, and detesting, the offences I have committed against Thee. I purpose for the future rather to die than ever to sin again; and for the love of Thee, I pardon all who have offended me. O God, I accept of death, and of all the suffering which will accompany it; I unite it with the sufferings and death of Jesus Christ, and offer it in acknowledgment of Thy supreme dominion, and in satisfaction for my sins. Do Thou, O Lord, accept of this sacrifice, which I make of my life, for the love of that great sacrifice which Thy divine Son made of Himself upon the altar of the cross. I resign myself entirely to Thy divine will, as though I were now on my death-bed, and protest that I wish to die, saying: \"O Lord, always Thy will be done!\" Most holy Virgin, my advocate and my Mother, Mary, thou art and wilt always be, after God, my hope and my consolation at the hour of death. From this moment I have recourse to thee, and beg of thee to assist me in that passage. O my dear Queen, do not abandon me in that last moment; come then to take my soul and present it to thy Son. Henceforward I shall expect thee; and I hope to die under thy mantle and clinging to thy feet. My protector St. Joseph, St. Michael archangel, my angel guardian, my holy patrons, do you all assist me in that last combat with hell. And Thou, my crucified Love, Thou my Jesus, Who wert pleased to choose for Thyself so bitter a death to obtain for me a good death, remember at that hour, that I am one of those dear sheep Thou didst purchase with Thy blood. Thou Who, when all the world shall have forsaken me, and not one shall be able to assist me, canst alone console me and save me. Do Thou make me worthy then to receive Thee in the Viaticum, and suffer me not to lose Thee forever and to be banished forever to a distance from Thee. No, my beloved Saviour, receive me then into Thy sacred wounds, for I now embrace Thee. At my last breath I intend to breathe forth my soul into the loving wound in Thy side, saying now for that moment, \"Jesus and Mary, I give you my heart and my soul!\" R. Jesus and Mary, I give you my heart and my soul. O happy suffering, to suffer for God! Happy death, to die in the Lord! I embrace Thee now, my good Redeemer, that I may die in Thy embraces. If, O my soul, Mary assists thee at thy departure, and Jesus receives thy last breath, it will not be death, but a sweet repose.",

Yet I would not wish to live longer, if my life were not wholly to be employed in loving and glorifying Thee. If it be Thy will that I die of this or of some other illness, may Thy holy name be equally praised. I receive death in order to fulfil Thy will; all I ask of Thee is to assist me in my last hour.\" Have mercy on me, O God, according to Thy great mercy.\" If it is Thy will that I should leave this earth, I protest not that I will die, because so it is Thy will. I will also die in order that, by the anguish and bitterness of my death, I may offer satisfaction to the divine justice for the many sins by which I have offended it and have thereby deserved hell. I will also die that I may no longer be able to offend Thee or cause Thee any displeasure. I will die to show Thee my gratitude for the numerous benefits and favors which, in spite of my unworthiness, I have received at Thy hands. I will die to show that I love Thy will more than my life. I wish, if it so pleases Thee, to die now while I hope to be in Thy grace, in order to be sure of praising and extolling Thee forever. But above all, I will die in order to love Thee with all my strength and forever in heaven, where through Thy precious blood, O my Saviour, I hope to arrive some day, and where I shall be certain to love Thee unceasingly. My Jesus, through love of me Thou didst will to suffer death on the cross; behold, I also through love of Thee accept death with all the sufferings which await me in my last hour, saying with St. Francis: \"Let me die, O Lord, through love of Thee, Who didst die through love of me.\" O my Redeemer, my Love, my only Good, I beseech Thee through Thy sacred wounds and painful death, let me die in Thy grace and love. O Jesus, my Saviour, I beseech Thee most particularly through the pains Thou didst endure when Thy most holy soul was separated from Thy adorable body, graciously to receive my soul on its leaving my body. O Mother of God, most blessed Virgin Mary, intercede with Jesus for me at the hour of my death, when in a most special manner I shall be in need of thy assistance. O Mary, Mother of grace, Mother of mercy, shield us from the enemy and receive us in the hour of death. To thy protection we fly, O holy Mother of God! Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners. O holy Joseph, my loving Father, assist me in that decisive moment. St. Michael, the archangel, deliver me from the evil spirits who lay snares for my soul.

Wherefore, O gracious God, O awful majesty, I, a wretched creature, entangled in difficulties, have recourse to You, the fount of mercy; to You I fly for healing and take refuge under Your protection, and I ardently desire to have Him as my Savior whom I am unable to face as my Judge. To You, Lord, I show my wounds, to You I lay bare my shame. I know that my sins are many and great and on their account I am filled with fear. But I trust in Your mercy, which is endless. Look down on me, therefore, with the eyes of mercy, Lord Jesus Christ, eternal King, God and Man, crucified for men. Hear me, for my hope is in You; have mercy on me, for I am full of sin and wretchedness, You who never cease to let flow the fountain of mercy.

Hail, noble and precious Blood, flowing from the wounds of my crucified Lord Jesus Christ washing away the sins of the whole world.

Take away from me, therefore, O most merciful Father, all my iniquities and my sins, that, being purified both in soul and body, I may worthily partake of the Holy of Holies; and grant that this holy oblation of Your Body and Blood, of which though unworthy I purpose to partake, may be to me the remission of my sins, the perfect cleansing of all my offenses, the means of driving away all evil thoughts and of renewing all holy desires, the accomplishment of works pleasing to You, as well as the strongest defense for soul and body against the snares of my enemies.

Help us to accept those who are afflicted in the same way that you did. Teach us to sympathize with their suffering and their pain. Teach us to listen to them with patience and to speak a consoling word. Let us show them how to trust in Saint Joseph, in Mary the mother of Jesus, and in God our Father. Your love of God was manifest in your plan to build a place of prayer on the mountain. With Saint Joseph, you yourself receive all those who come to the Oratory. Plant within them faith in God who loves them so much and who wishes wholeness for every human being. Make them grateful for all the graces they have received and confident in the future that is theirs. Help them to make prayer a part of their life and to become people that others can rely on. Brother André, you are now with the saints in glory; you are powerful with God. Continue the ministry you conducted when you were on earth. Obtain healing for those who are suffering in mind and body. Give serenity to those advanced in years, and gainful work for those who seek it. Inspire the young to live good Christian lives, in marriage, in consecrated life, as ordained pastors. Teach all of us how to live as Jesus did. Amen.",

        "prayer": "This first native Korean priest was the son of Korean converts. His father, Ignatius Kim, was martyred during the persecution of 1839 and was beatified in 1925. After baptism at the age of fifteen, Andrew traveled thirteen hundred miles to the seminary in Macao, China. After six years he managed to return to his country through Manchuria. That same year he crossed the Yellow Sea to Shanghai and was ordained a priest. Back home again, he was assigned to arrange for more missionaries to enter by a water route that would elude the border patrol. He was arrested, tortured and finally beheaded at the Han River near Seoul, the capital. Paul Chong Hasang was a lay apostle and a married man, aged forty-five. Christianity came to Korea during the Japanese invasion in 1592 when some Koreans were baptized, probably by Christian Japanese soldiers. Evangelization was difficult because Korea refused all contact with the outside world except for an annual journey to Beijing to pay taxes. On one of these occasions, around 1777, Christian literature obtained from Jesuits in China led educated Korean Christians to study. A home church began. When a Chinese priest managed to enter secretly a dozen years later, he found four thousand Catholics, none of whom had ever seen a priest. Seven years later there were ten thousand Catholics. Religious freedom came in 1883. When Pope John Paul II visited Korea in 1984, he canonized Andrew, Paul, ninety-eight Koreans and three French missionaries who had been martyred between 1839 and 1867. Among them were bishops and priests, but for the most part they were laypersons: forty-seven women, forty-five men. Among the martyrs in 1839 was Columba Kim, an unmarried woman of twenty-six. She was put in prison, pierced with hot awls and seared with burning coals. She and her sister Agnes were disrobed and kept for two days in a cell with condemned criminals, but were not molested. After Columba complained about the indignity, no more women were subjected to it. The two were beheaded. A boy of thirteen, Peter Ryou, had his flesh so badly torn that he could pull off pieces and throw them at the judges. He was killed by strangulation. Protase Chong, a forty-one-year-old noble, apostatized under torture and was freed. Later he came back, confessed his faith and was tortured to death.",

May you draw closer to God who calls us to be his hands, feets, voice and presence in our world. Beginning of Novena in preparation for the feast of Saint Angela Merici: Angela’s prayer, her union with her God, is reflected in the intimacy with which she shares with us, her beloved daughers, her love of Jesus. “I am constantly among you with my Lover, or rather the Lover of each of us.”  5th Counsel “… our gentle, loving Spouse, Jesus Christ.”  Rule 12 “Lord, I beg you for tis by your most Sacred Passion, by your Precious  Blood shed for love of us, by your holy name, Jesus.  Rule 6 “…you will find no other recourse than shelter at the feet of Jesus Christ.” 7th Counsel Reflection and Questions to pray with:  As Angela’s words speak to your heart, experience the tenderness and the reverence which reflects her union with Jesus. Her prayer was a loving communion with Jesus whom she loved. –In my own experience with God, can I relate to Angela’s union, her intimacy, her joy in loving? –As her daughter/follower, share with Angela your experience, your relationship with the Trinity. –Join Angela “at the feet of Jesus Christ, and savor the sacred time and space with Jesus, the Lover of each of us.  Unburden your heart and bring to Jesus those who you carry in your heart and prayer.",

        "quote": "Intuition is a fully formed way of thinking. It is more than just the occasional hunch or subtle perception. Native instinct, or “gut,” is used to calculate, discern, and decide on matters big and small throughout daily life. We think we are dryly logical about a decision to trust one accountant and not another, to frequent this store over that, or to confide in this new friend rather than that old one. But in reality it may just be a small mustard stain on the accountant’s shirt collar that convinces us that he is not the right man for the job. Squinty eyes, a weak handshake, a laugh, or just the way someone holds open the door or sips their coffee. We pay very close attention to the slightest nuances of facial gestures, body language, and tone of voice to draw immediate conclusions about people. We are not as coldly rational as we like to think. So when an atheist, for example, walks alone down a remote country road in the dark of night and hears a long lost voice in the whistling wind, or sees tree branches twist themselves into a bony finger, he grows frightened. If he were to feel the breathy presence of someone hovering just over his shoulder at that same moment, the atheist’s sober rationality would be worth nothing. His throttle of feeling and intuition would be fully open, the pores of his mind would absorb every ounce of strange reality, and a shiver of fright would run up his spine like an electrical charge. He would be in full contact with a reality as elusive to describe, yet as normal to experience, as intuition itself.  The holy guardian angels are created spirits, whereas God is an uncreated spirit. A man, however, is more than a spirit. He is an enfleshed soul procreated by parents who participate in God’s creative act. Though we are part spirit and part matter, we can nonetheless imagine what it would be like to be a pure spirit, like an angel. We close our eyes and imagine standing at the pinnacle of the Eiffel Tower in Paris and suddenly we are there, gazing over the City of Lights. The mind travels, the imagination soars, the soul reflects. It’s our body that keeps our feet planted in one place and time. But if mind, soul, and imagination were not so tethered, then we would zip around the universe like an angel, a spirit unleashed, held back by nothing. God created the angels like He created us, out of nothing. God’s will is creative in the strict sense of that word. “Let there be light,” He said, and there was light. His will brings worlds into creation and maintains them there. God willed the angels into creation to communicate His messages, to protect mankind, and to engage in spiritual battle with fallen demon angels. The age-old tradition of the Church is that every Christian, and perhaps every human being, has an angel guardian protecting him from physical and spiritual harm. Christ warned, “Take care that you do not despise one of these little ones; for, I tell you, in heaven their angels continually see the face of my Father in heaven” (Mt 18:10). An angel was at Christ’s side in the Garden of Gethsemane, and an angel delivered Saint Peter from prison. The Fathers of the early Church wrote prolifically about the dense realm of the spirit inhabited by angels. The Catechism of the Catholic Church notes that the angels belong to Christ. “They are his angels” (CCC #331). The Catechism also quotes Saint Basil, “Beside each believer stands an angel as protector and shepherd leading him to life” (CCC #336). We intuit that the world was made for more than just us, whether those “others” are lit with holiness or obscured by darkness. Some people scan the skies for alien ships in Low-Earth Orbit. Others listen for strange patterns of speech transmitted like radio signals through the cosmos. Is there life on Mars? Are there colonies behind the sun? There is no need to search so far, to seek life in the cold blackness of space. There are spirits all around us. Some need to walk down a dark country road to finally touch the realm of the spirit. Others are more fortunate and know from childhood that our guardian angels are present and accounted for, standing right over our shoulder, at God’s constant command to serve and protect.",
        "prayer": "Holy Guardian Angels, we implore your continued vigilance over our lives. Keep us from physical and spiritual harm, increase our trust in your presence, and remind us to turn to you when our well-being is threatened in any way.",

Where can God come into me, God who made heaven and earth? Is there, indeed, O Lord my God, anything in me that can contain you? Do then, heaven and earth, which you have made, and in which you have made me, contain you? Or because nothing which exists could exist without you, does therefore whatever exists contain you? Since then I too exist, why do I seek that you should enter me. I would not be if you were not in me. Why? Because I am not gone down in hell, and yet you are there also. For if I go down into hell, you are there. I could not be then, O my God, could not be at all, if you were not in me; or rather, unless I were in you, of whom are all things, by whom are all things, in whom are all things! Even so, Lord, even so. From where should I call you, since I am in you? Or where can you enter me? For where can I go beyond heaven and earth, that there my God should come into me, who has said, “I fill the heaven and the earth”? O God, the vessels which you fill do not contain you, since though we were broken, you were not poured out. You are not cast down, but you uplift us. You are not scattered, but you gather us….

Remember, O Lord, that during the Last Supper with Thy disciples, having washed their feet, Thou gavest them Thy Most Precious Body and Blood, and while at the same time Thou didst sweetly console them, Thou didst foretell them Thy coming Passion. Remember the sadness and bitterness which Thou didst experience in Thy Soul as Thou Thyself bore witness saying: \"My Soul is sorrowful even unto death.\" Remember all the fear, anguish and pain that Thou didst suffer in Thy delicate Body before the torment of the Crucifixion, when, after having prayed three times, bathed in a sweat of blood, Thou wast betrayed by Judas, Thy disciple, arrested by the people of a nation Thou hadst chosen and elevated, accused by false witnesses, unjustly judged by three judges during the flower of Thy youth and during the solemn Paschal season. Remember that Thou wast despoiled of Thy garments and clothed in those of derision; that Thy Face and Eyes were veiled, that Thou wast buffeted, crowned with thorns, a reed placed in Thy Hands, that Thou was crushed with blows and overwhelmed with affronts and outrages. In memory of all these pains and sufferings which Thou didst endure before Thy Passion on the Cross, grant me before my death true contrition, a sincere and entire confession, worthy satisfaction and the remission of all my sins. Amen.",

He was caught and sent to prison.  He was released and told to try to recover the money.  This time, he was arrested after getting into a brawl in a Jewish synagogue.  He was then sent to Sardenia to work in the mines.  The mistress of the emperor was able to influence his release. Callistus became superintendent of the cemetery of St. Callistus.  He was ordained a deacon by the Pope and became the friend and adviser of the Pope.  When the pope died, Callistus was elected to be Bishop of Rome with a majority vote.  This led to a schism with his rival St. Hippolytus who became the first anti-pope.  Hippolytus accused Pope Callistus of sympathizing with heretics.  He also disagreed with Pope Callistus’ teaching about the power of Divine Mercy in the sacrament of confession. In the year 236, both Pope Callistus and Hyppolytus were martyred during an uprising in Rome.  They were both canonized as saints.  It is believed that Hyppolytus made peace with the church before his death. St. Callistus is the first pope after St. Peter to be honored as a martyr.",

        "quote": "Casimir, born of kings and in line to be a king himself, was filled with exceptional values and learning by a great teacher, John Dlugosz. Even his critics could not say that his conscientious objection indicated softness. As a teenager, Casimir lived a highly disciplined, even severe life, sleeping on the ground, spending a great part of the night in prayer and dedicating himself to lifelong celibacy. When nobles in Hungary became dissatisfied with their king, they prevailed upon Casimir’s father, the king of Poland, to send his son to take over the country. Casimir obeyed his father, as many young men over the centuries have obeyed their governments. The army he was supposed to lead was clearly outnumbered by the “enemy”; some of his troops were deserting because they were not paid. At the advice of his officers, Casimir decided to return home. His father was irked at the failure of his plans, and confined his 15-year-old son for three months. The lad made up his mind never again to become involved in the wars of his day, and no amount of persuasion could change his mind. He returned to prayer and study, maintaining his decision to remain celibate even under pressure to marry the emperor’s daughter. He reigned briefly as king of Poland during his father’s absence. He died of lung trouble at 25 while visiting Lithuania, of which he was also Grand Duke. He was buried in Vilnius, Lithuania.",

St. Catherine was born around 287 in Alexandria, Egypt.  She was the daughter of a wealthy pagan couple. She had a love of learning and studied philosophy and religion. After studying Christianity, she converted. Legend tells us that she was imprisoned and tortured by Emperero Maxentius after she refused to marry him. He forced her to debate the most learned pagan philosophers hoping she would commit apostasy, however the debates resulted in many conversions to the Christian faith. St. Catherine was tortured by being placed on a wheel full of spikes in an attempt to kill her. The wheel broke into two pieces and fell apart. She was then beheaded.",

        "quote": "Denis and his companions were so effective in converting people that the pagan priests became alarmed over their loss of followers. At their instigation, the Roman Governor arrested the missionaries. After a long imprisonment, Denis and two of his clergy were executed by beheading on the highest hill in Paris (now Montmartre), which was likely to have been a druidic holy place. The martyrdom of Denis and his companions is popularly believed to have given the site its current name, derived from the Latin Mons Martyrum \"The Martyrs' Mountain\", although the name is possibly derived from Mons Mercurii et Mons Martis, Hill of Mercury and Mars. After his head was cut off, Denis is said to have picked it up and walked several miles from the summit of the hill, preaching a sermon the entire way, making him one of many cephalophores in hagiology. Of the many accounts of this martyrdom, this is noted in detail in the Golden Legend and in Butler's Lives Of The Saints. The site where he stopped preaching and actually died was marked by a small shrine that developed into the Basilica of Saint-Denis, which became the burial place for the kings of France. Another account has his corpse being thrown into the Seine, but recovered and buried later that night by his converts.",

Moreover, I beseech You to graciously grant me, through the merits and intercession of this powerful Helper, the petition which through them I humbly place before You, devoutly saying, \"Thy will be done on earth as it is in Heaven.\" Vouchsafe graciously to hear it, if it is to Your greater glory and the salvation of my soul.

He was soon elected the next Bishop of Rome! He served as pope for 14 years and was known for his sanctity. There was peace at the time of his election. However, after the death of the emperor Philip, Decius, the new emperor began to persecute Christians, demanding that they worship idols. Pope Fabian held fast to the faith and was martyred in the year 250. He is buried in the Catacombs of St. Callistus which he helped to restore. The stone on his grave has the following words in Greek: “Fabian, bishop, martyr”.",

Her sister Gertrude married King Andrew II of Hungary and their daughter was Saint Elizabeth of Hungary. Hedwig was married at an early age to Henry, Duke of Silesia. They had seven children, including Gertrude, who would become abbess of a Cistercian monastery founded in 1202 by her parents, the first convent of religious women in Silesia. Three of their children died at an early age. Hedwig and Henry were great benefactors who endowed Cistercian, Augustinian and Dominican monasteries, and a hospital.  They also consecrated themselves to lives of great austerity, piety and self-sacrifice. After her husband’s death in 1241, Duchess Hedwig assumed the habit and life of a Cistercian at the Abbey of Treblinz, though she did not enter as a religious in order that she could retain her ability to donate to charities. She was known for her great generosity, her care for the poor and sick, and for her piety and gentleness. When she died in 1243 (October 12 or 15), Hedwig was buried in the church attached to the Cistercian monastery in Treblinz. She was canonized by Pope Clement IV on March 26, 1267, and in August of the same year her remains were raised to the honors of the altar (that is, interred beneath an altar). Images of Saint Hedwig often show her with a church, referring to the monasteries she endowed. In the image above, she is holding an image of the Blessed Virgin, a prayerbook and rosary, and with her boots folded over her right arm, which refers to her penitential practice of going barefoot.",
        "prayer": "O St Hedwig, in this world you rejected the honors of the Court, its pomp, luxury and pleasures, and went to be with the poor to help them in the destitution and misery of life. There in Heaven, cast a kind look on us poor mortals, and obtain for us the grace (mention your request) and that of living in the peace and friendship of God. Amen. V. Pray for us, St Hedwig! R. So that we may be worthy of the promises of Christ. Let us pray: O God, You taught Blessed Hedwig to prefer, with all her heart, the humble road of Your Cross to the pomp of the world. Through her merits and example, grant that we may learn to reject the ephemeral delights of the world, and, embracing Your Cross, may we overcome the adversities to come. You who live and reign, One God, forever and ever. Our Father, Hail Mary, Glory Be",

        "quote": "As German king and Holy Roman Emperor, Henry was a practical man of affairs. He was energetic in consolidating his rule. He crushed rebellions and feuds. On all sides he had to deal with drawn-out disputes so as to protect his frontiers. This involved him in a number of battles, especially in the south in Italy; he also helped Pope Benedict VIII quell disturbances in Rome. Always his ultimate purpose was to establish a stable peace in Europe. According to eleventh-century custom, Henry took advantage of his position and appointed as bishops men loyal to him. In his case, however, he avoided the pitfalls of this practice and actually fostered the reform of ecclesiastical and monastic life. He was canonized in 1146.",

In the midst of the changes of this world, may his prayers keep us free from sin and help us on our way towards you. Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son, who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit, one God, for ever and ever. Amen.",

Isaac Jogues was born in Orleans, France, in 1607. He became a Jesuit in 1624, and in 1636 he traveled to Quebec with a group of missionaries, under the leadership of John de Brebeuf. The priests converted some of the Hurons, but in 1642 Isaac Jogues and several other missionaries, along with some of their Huron converts, were captured by an Iroquois war party. The Jesuits were tortured for 13 months, and the Huron Christians were murdered. ADVERTISEMENT - CONTINUE READING BELOW Isaac Jogues finally escaped and returned to France, where he was welcomed as a hero. He was allowed by Pope Urban VII the very exceptional privilege of celebrating Mass, even though the mutilated condition of his tortured hands made this impossible according to canonical norms. This was the first time such a concession had been granted. The Holy Father stated, “It would be unfitting to refuse permission to drink the blood of Jesus Christ to one who has testified to Christ with his blood.” Isaac was invited by the Jesuits to stay in his homeland to teach, but he desired the conversion of pagans, so he returned to North America to continue his missionary work in the New World. In 1646 the Mohawks captured Isaac Jogues and John de Lalande; they were tomahawked and beheaded on October 18 in the area that later became upstate New York. John de Brebeuf made two missionary journeys to the Hurons despite many difficulties, such as when the Huron medicine men blamed the Jesuits for an epidemic of smallpox. John composed catechisms and a dictionary of the Huron language, and eventually his efforts bore fruit: 7000 of the Hurons were converted. In 1649 he and St. Gabriel Lalemant were captured by the Iroquois, and tortured for several hours before dying.",

May I die only for you, if you will grant me this grace, since you willingly died for me. Let me so live that you may grant me the gift of such a happy death.

There it is that the fruits of our farm labor, bread and wine, are brought and offered to God by the priest. Then, in the consecration, Christ Himself, Body and Blood, Soul and Divinity, becomes present on our altars under the appearances of this same bread and wine. And in what was the altar bread, He comes to us to be the very food of our souls. If we deeply realize the value and beauty of Holy Mass, we will be very happy to attend as often as we possibly can. Help us to understand that in the Mass we offer ourselves to God with Christ by the hands of the priest. There we can bring to God all that we do, and offer it to Him in union with His Holy Sacrifice. The oftener we do this now, the happier we shall be hereafter. Good Saint Isidore, bless us and our labors, that we may some day reap the reward of good works with you in heaven. Amen.",

Obtain for us, we pray you, some of that loving devotion to the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass. There it is that the fruits of our farm labor, bread and wine, are brought and offered to God by the priest. Then, in the consecration, Christ Himself, Body and Blood, Soul and Divinity, becomes present on our altars under the appearances of this same bread and wine. And in what was the altar bread, He comes to us to be the very food of our souls. If we deeply realize the value and beauty of Holy Mass, we will be very happy to attend as often as we possibly can. Help us to understand that in the Mass we offer ourselves to God with Christ by the hands of the priest. There we can bring to God all that we do, and offer it to Him in union with His Holy Sacrifice. The oftener we do this now, the happier we shall be hereafter. Good Saint Isidore, bless us and our labors, that we may some day reap the reward of good works with you in heaven. Amen.",

        "quote": "Many centuries ago, St. Januarius died for the Faith in the persecution of Diocletian, and to this day God confirms the faith of His Church, and works a continual miracle, through the blood which Januarius shed for Him. The Saint was Bishop of Beneventum, and on one occasion he travelled to Misenum in order to visit a deacon named Sosius. During this visit Januarius saw the head of Sosius, who was singing the gospel in the church, girt with flames, and took this for a sign that ere long Sosius would wear the crown of martyrdom. So it proved. Shortly after Sosius was arrested, and thrown into prison. There St. Januarius visited and encouraged him, till the bishop also was arrested in turn. Soon the number of the confessors was swollen by some of the neighboring clergy. They were exposed to the wild beasts in the amphitheatre. The beasts, however, did them no harm; and at last the Governor of Campania ordered the Saints to be beheaded. Little did the heathen governor think that he was the instrument in God’s hand of ushering in the long succession of miracles which attest the faith of Januarius. The relics of St. Januarius rest in the cathedral of Naples, and it is there that the liquefaction of his blood occurs. The blood is congealed in two glass vials, but when it is brought near the martyr’s head it melts and flows like the blood of a living man.",
        "prayer": "Oh Gennaro, brave of faith in Jesus Christ, glorious patron of Catholic Naples, looks upon us benignly and accepts our vows, that today we lie at your feet with total confidence in your powerful patronage. How many times have you run to help your fellow citizens, now stopping in the path of the destructive lava of Vesuvius, and now saving us from plague, earthquakes, famine and many other divine punishments that terrify us. The perpetual miracle of the liquefaction of your blood is a sure and extremely eloquent sign that you live among us, that you know our needs and that you protect us in a singular way. Oh, we pray you to pray for us, sure that we will be answered; and saved from all the evils that oppress us from all directions. Save us from unbelief, and you will see that the faith, by which you have generously sacrificed your life, always, always produces fertile fruits of saints made among us. Amen.",

At that time, the ruler of Italy was Theodoric the Goth who subscribed to the Arian brand of Christianity, but had tolerated and even favored his Catholic subjects during the early part of his reign. However, about the time of St. John's accession to the Papacy, Theodoric's policy underwent a drastic change as a result of two events: the treasonable (in the sovereign's view) correspondence between ranking members of the Roman Senate and Constantinople and the severe edict against heretics enacted by the emperor Justin I, who was the first Catholic on the Byzantine throne in fifty years. Spurred on by the appeals of Eastern Arians, Theodoric threatened to wage war against Justin but ultimately decided to negotiate with him through a delegation of five Bishops and four senators. At its head he named Pope John - much against the latter's wishes. Little is known for certain about the nature of the message which the Pope bore and the manner in which he carried out his mission. What is known is that he succeeded in persuading the Emperor to mitigate his treatment of the Arians and thus avoid reprisals against the Catholics in Italy. The Pope's visit also brought about the reconciliation of the Western and Eastern Churches which had been plagued by a schism since 482 when Zeno's Henoticon had been published. However, Theodoric had been becoming more suspicious with each passing day. While waiting for the delegation to return, he ordered the execution of the philosopher Boethius and his father-in-law Symmachus on a charge of treason; and as he got word of the friendly relations between the Pope and the emperor, he concluded that they were plotting against him. Hence, on the delegation's return to the capitol city of Ravenna, Pope John was imprisoned by order of Theodoric and died a short time later as a result of the treatment he experienced there.",

        "prayer": "The following prayers are based on the life and writings of St. John. There is one for each day of the Novena. Day 1: St. John Chrysostom, our patron, eloquent preacher, pray for us. Your words so inspired those who heard you that people named you “golden mouth.” Intercede for us that we, too, may learn to speak in ways that draw others to Christ. By your example teach us how to make our words beautiful, kind and strong. Pray that we may know when to speak and when to keep silent and at all times to proclaim with our tongues and with the actions of our bodies God’s Holy Word. Day 2: St. John Chrysostom, our patron, example of humility, pray for us. You were admired in your day but you knew the dangers of such admiration. You wrote, “I do not know whether anyone has ever succeeded in not enjoying praise, and if he enjoys it, he naturally wants to receive it. And if he wants to receive it, he cannot help being pained and distraught at losing it.\" Pray that we will accept the affirmation of others as praise not of us but of God from whom all good gifts come. May we never become puffed up and prideful but use our gifts in the service of God and God’s people. Day 3: St. John Chrysostom, our patron, prophetic witness, pray for us. You were unafraid to denounce sin and injustice wherever you saw it – whether it was in a lowly gambler, a powerful aristocrat or a prince of the Church. Pray that we may also be steadfast and courageous when we are called to speak, that we may reject cowardice in all its forms and resist the powers which would silence us. Help us never to sanction injustice either by sins of commission or omission.  Day 4: St. John Chrysostom, our patron, trusting disciple, pray for us. The penalty for your faithfulness to God was persecution and banishment. Intercede for us when we are wrongfully accused, maligned and persecuted that we may have the strength to trust that God is with us, that we may offer our sufferings to God with penitential hearts and that we may be strengthened to return love for hate. Through your example, may we learn to trust God in times of difficulty and be strengthened to follow the command of Christ to love even our enemies. Day 5: St. John Chrysostom, our patron, prayerful believer, pray for us. You wrote that prayer is the “light of the soul.” Guide us to be deliberate and faithful in our prayer, so that our souls may be both “gladdened and given rest.” Pray that we may learn to taste the rich food of communion with God and that this may nurture in us a desire for the heavenly banquet. Help us to pray not only when we are thinking of prayer but in each and every act of our life. Day 6: St. John Chrysostom, our patron, compassionate voice for the poor, pray for us. You were an advocate for all those who were voiceless from the unborn to the poor. You taught that, \"It is foolishness and a public madness to fill the cupboards with clothing, and allow people who are created in God's image and likeness to stand naked and trembling with the cold.\" You gave most of what you had to those in need. Be, for us, an example of what it means to be generous to those in most need of protection and care. Pray that we may live simply for the good of others and for the good of all creation. Day 7: St. John Chrysostom, our patron, repentant sinner, pray for us. You proclaimed, \"I fear nothing, except sin.\" Be our companion so that we may learn from your example and be courageous and bold in following our faith, knowing that nothing can separate us from the love of Christ. Intercede for us to Heaven, that we may have the insight to recognize sin in ourselves and in our world and that we may have the desire to resist it and act instead in love and justice. Day 8: St. John Chrysostom, our patron, recipient of Divine mercy, pray for us. You had great confidence in God’s merciful forgiveness. You wrote, “Have you sinned? Come to Church. Tell God, ‘I have sinned.’ …Admit the sin to annul it. This requires neither labor nor a circuit of words, nor monetary expenditure, nor anything else whatsoever such as these. Say one word, think carefully about the sin and say, ‘I have sinned.’” Pray that we will share your confidence in God’s mercy, repent of our sins and be merciful to our brothers and sisters, forgiving them as God forgives us. Day 9: St. John Chrysostom, our patron, servant of God’s people, pray for us. You saw that even in the world of nature, service is to be praised. “The bee,” you reminded us,” is more honored than other animals, not because she labors, but because she labors for others.” Pray, that like the bee, we may live lives marked not by selfishness, but by service to others. Intercede for us, that we may be saved and live forever in the communion of saints, with Christ, our Lord. Concluding Prayers After saying the daily (or hourly, if you choose) prayers, conclude by saying the following: Invocation Lord, God of inconceivable power, incomprehensible glory, immeasurable mercy, unspeakable kindness, look on us in your tender love and show your rich mercy and compassion to us and those who pray with us.

Be, for us, an example of what it means to be generous to those in most need of protection and care. Pray that we may live simply for the good of others and for the good of all creation. Day 7: St. John Chrysostom, our patron, repentant sinner, pray for us. You proclaimed, \"I fear nothing, except sin.\" Be our companion so that we may learn from your example and be courageous and bold in following our faith, knowing that nothing can separate us from the love of Christ. Intercede for us to Heaven, that we may have the insight to recognize sin in ourselves and in our world and that we may have the desire to resist it and act instead in love and justice. Day 8: St. John Chrysostom, our patron, recipient of Divine mercy, pray for us. You had great confidence in God’s merciful forgiveness. You wrote, “Have you sinned? Come to Church. Tell God, ‘I have sinned.’ …Admit the sin to annul it. This requires neither labor nor a circuit of words, nor monetary expenditure, nor anything else whatsoever such as these. Say one word, think carefully about the sin and say, ‘I have sinned.’” Pray that we will share your confidence in God’s mercy, repent of our sins and be merciful to our brothers and sisters, forgiving them as God forgives us. Day 9: St. John Chrysostom, our patron, servant of God’s people, pray for us. You saw that even in the world of nature, service is to be praised. “The bee,” you reminded us,” is more honored than other animals, not because she labors, but because she labors for others.” Pray, that like the bee, we may live lives marked not by selfishness, but by service to others. Intercede for us, that we may be saved and live forever in the communion of saints, with Christ, our Lord. Concluding Prayers After saying the daily (or hourly, if you choose) prayers, conclude by saying the following: Invocation Lord, God of inconceivable power, incomprehensible glory, immeasurable mercy, unspeakable kindness, look on us in your tender love and show your rich mercy and compassion to us and those who pray with us. Amen.",

        "quote": "Not to share our own wealth with the poor is theft from the poor and deprivation of their means of life; we do not possess our own wealth, but theirs.",
        "prayer": "The following prayers are based on the life and writings of St. John. There is one for each day of the Novena. Day 1: St. John Chrysostom, our patron, eloquent preacher, pray for us. Your words so inspired those who heard you that people named you “golden mouth.” Intercede for us that we, too, may learn to speak in ways that draw others to Christ. By your example teach us how to make our words beautiful, kind and strong. Pray that we may know when to speak and when to keep silent and at all times to proclaim with our tongues and with the actions of our bodies God’s Holy Word. Day 2: St. John Chrysostom, our patron, example of humility, pray for us. You were admired in your day but you knew the dangers of such admiration. You wrote, “I do not know whether anyone has ever succeeded in not enjoying praise, and if he enjoys it, he naturally wants to receive it. And if he wants to receive it, he cannot help being pained and distraught at losing it.\" Pray that we will accept the affirmation of others as praise not of us but of God from whom all good gifts come. May we never become puffed up and prideful but use our gifts in the service of God and God’s people. Day 3: St. John Chrysostom, our patron, prophetic witness, pray for us. You were unafraid to denounce sin and injustice wherever you saw it – whether it was in a lowly gambler, a powerful aristocrat or a prince of the Church. Pray that we may also be steadfast and courageous when we are called to speak, that we may reject cowardice in all its forms and resist the powers which would silence us. Help us never to sanction injustice either by sins of commission or omission.  Day 4: St. John Chrysostom, our patron, trusting disciple, pray for us. The penalty for your faithfulness to God was persecution and banishment. Intercede for us when we are wrongfully accused, maligned and persecuted that we may have the strength to trust that God is with us, that we may offer our sufferings to God with penitential hearts and that we may be strengthened to return love for hate. Through your example, may we learn to trust God in times of difficulty and be strengthened to follow the command of Christ to love even our enemies. Day 5: St. John Chrysostom, our patron, prayerful believer, pray for us. You wrote that prayer is the “light of the soul.” Guide us to be deliberate and faithful in our prayer, so that our souls may be both “gladdened and given rest.” Pray that we may learn to taste the rich food of communion with God and that this may nurture in us a desire for the heavenly banquet. Help us to pray not only when we are thinking of prayer but in each and every act of our life. Day 6: St. John Chrysostom, our patron, compassionate voice for the poor, pray for us. You were an advocate for all those who were voiceless from the unborn to the poor. You taught that, \"It is foolishness and a public madness to fill the cupboards with clothing, and allow people who are created in God's image and likeness to stand naked and trembling with the cold.\" You gave most of what you had to those in need. Be, for us, an example of what it means to be generous to those in most need of protection and care. Pray that we may live simply for the good of others and for the good of all creation.

Through his heavenly intercession, please grant the following petition(s) . . . Here state your request(s). Grant also that I may grow in love for You and proclaim boldly the love of Jesus Christ to all people. Through Christ, Our Lord. Amen. Day 1 Dear Saint John Paul, you preached: “The future starts today, not tomorrow.” As I start these nine days of prayer with you, I thank you for reminding me that with God’s help, I can begin again, but I need to start now, not at some distant point in the future. Your words are encouraging and inspiring to me. Please be with me as I progress through these nine days of prayer with you. Dear Lord, You are the greatest Healer. You gave Saint John Paul II to the entire world to show us how much You love us. With Your mighty power and through his intercession, we seek healing, not just of our physical body but our emotional, mental, social and spiritual health as well. In keeping with Your greatest commandment, we will love You with all our heart, with all our mind, with all our soul and with all our strength. We will also love our neighbor as we love ourselves. Amen. Conclude with the Our Father, Hail Mary, and Glory Be prayers. Day 2 Dear Saint John Paul, you preached: “I plead with you, never, ever give up on hope. Never doubt, never tire, and never become discouraged. Be not afraid.” With your help, I will not give up hope. I will be trusting, confident, persistent and unafraid in prayer. God, our Father, grant us the peace we seek when confronted with different obstacles each day. Guide us so we won’t falter in our steps. May peace always reign in our hearts even if there is fear that we might fall flat on our face. We will not be anxious, but will have faith that is unwavering like that of Saint John Paul II. We will do whatever is true, honorable, just, pure, lovely and gracious in Your eyes, so that Your peace may abide in our hearts always. Amen. Conclude with the Our Father, Hail Mary, and Glory Be prayers. Day 3 Dear Saint John Paul, you preached: “Have no fear of moving into the unknown. Simply step out fearlessly knowing that I am with you and therefore no harm can befall you. All is very, very well. Do this in complete faith and confidence.” What more can I say, but thank you for your confidence in me. Help me to have complete faith in God. Stand with me at all times as my intercessor and spiritual guide until I attain the great treasure of Heaven. Dear Jesus, Son of the living God, we rejoice because we believe that through the intercession of Saint John Paul II, our healing is near at hand. We are joyful in our ways and our speech for we know that You will always comfort us as a mother comforts her children. We thank you for the joy You’ve given us when You were born into our world, because You became one of us in all things but sin. You endured tremendous suffering for our sake, so that we will be saved from our sins. Turn our mourning into rejoicing because of Your resurrection from the dead. Amen. Conclude with the Our Father, Hail Mary, and Glory Be prayers. Day 4 Dear Saint John Paul, just like St. Paul the Apostle who described his journey as a race, you tell me that life with Jesus is a wonderful adventure. Life is not a sprint for me, but rather a winding marathon with its curves and its ups and downs. Help me by being with me at all times as I struggle in this race toward the fullness of life in Christ. God the Holy Spirit, grant us wisdom and knowledge as we wait patiently for the healing You promised. May our families be blessed with patience in helping us cope with illness and other problems. During his lifetime, Saint John Paul was a living testimony of how much God loves us through his patience in dealing with every religious or political leader around the world, as well as with the severe sicknesses that afflicted him. We believe that as long as love reigns in our hearts each day, we will be healed, for “Love is patient and kind.” Amen. Conclude with the Our Father, Hail Mary, and Glory Be prayers. Day 5  Dear Saint John Paul, you preached: “Do not abandon yourselves to despair. We are the Easter people and Hallelujah is our song.” Help me to be joyful in this wonderful adventure of life. Help me always to have true Christian joy in my heart, mind and spirit. Help me always to be faithful to the Will of God in my life. Through God’s loving grace and kindness, we have been blessed with the great kindness shown by the people who take care of us, like our family, friends, relatives, caregivers, physicians, rehabilitation specialists, nutritionists and spiritual advisers. Saint John Paul II manifested incredible love, kindness and forgiveness to the man who tried to assassinate him. We believe that we will be healed if we forgive those who have wronged us, and if we extend a helping hand to our least sisters and brothers living in distress, poverty and need. Amen. Conclude with the Our Father, Hail Mary, and Glory Be prayers. Day 6 Dear Saint John Paul, you preached: “Love your families. Teach them the dignity of life. Teach them the ways of harmony and peace. Teach them the value of faith and prayer and goodness! Help transform the world around you by giving the best of yourselves in the service of others and your country.” Just as Christ taught us, you preached and live the Golden Rule: “Do unto others as you would have them do to you.” How simple it is to hear this, but how incredibly difficult, at times, to do this. Be with me, and help me see God in my neighbor and in all those I find difficult to love or accept. Dear Lord, throughout my lifetime, I have been taught to be a good person and to be a blessing to others. To be good is not just to follow the rules, but more so, to follow You and obey Your commandments. May I bring harmony and peace to others, and spread Your good news to my family, my friends, my community and my country. Saint John Paul II made Your goodness known throughout the world by welcoming and embracing everyone who sought Your presence, regardless of age, gender or creed. Through Your goodness and mercy, we will receive the healing we seek through the intercession of Saint John Paul II. Amen. Conclude with the Our Father, Hail Mary, and Glory Be prayers. Day 7 Dear Saint John Paul, you preached: “The goal and target of our life is He, the Christ who awaits us – each one singly and all together – to lead us across the boundaries of time to the eternal embrace of the God who loves us.” Help me, dear Saint John Paul, to remember that life with God is the highest and greatest of all goals. In every moment of my life, help me to be focused on my relationship with Christ, so that when my earthly journey ends, my eternal life with Jesus will begin. God the Father, in humility we offer our lives to You in the service of others. May we be like Saint John Paul II in proclaiming our faith and trust in You, so we will be blessed and can fulfill our Christian vocation. It is through our weakness and illness that You have touched our lives, and we now seek Your goodness and mercy to be healed. Amen. Conclude with the Our Father, Hail Mary, and Glory Be prayers. Day 8 Dear Saint John Paul, you preached: “People are made for happiness. Rightly, then, you thirst for happiness. Christ has the answer to this desire of yours. But He asks you to trust Him. True joy is a victory, something which cannot be obtained without a long and difficult struggle. Christ holds the secret of this victory. . . In order to sing God’s praises we must re-learn the language of humility and trust, the language of moral integrity and of sincere commitment to all that is truly good in the sight of the Lord.” Once again, in simple words, you teach us that nothing is more important than life with Christ. Lord, Jesus Christ, grant me the gift of a humble heart so that I can respond to Your call to take up the Cross and follow You each day as Your disciple. I will strive to preserve the unity in my household through my actions of peace and understanding. Through the intercession of Saint John Paul II, please grant me the gift of healing that I earnestly implore. Amen. Conclude with the Our Father, Hail Mary, and Glory Be prayers. Day 9 Dear Saint John Paul, the surest, straightest road to Christ is through His Holy Mother. When I am lost and confused in life, lead me to place myself before Our Blessed Mother, asking her to rescue me to faithfully live the spiritual path that leads to her Divine Son. Teach me to have in my heart the same great love you had for our Blessed Mother. Dear Lord, You are the Greatest Healer. Everything I have comes from You: my life, my health, my family, my friends, my possessions and all that truly matters. I surrender them all to You as I search for meaning and purpose in all that is happening to me. I claim complete healing of my mind, body, heart and soul. I claim healing for those who are suffering and are lost. I claim healing for my family. I claim financial blessings so I can be a blessing to others. Grant me the patience to confidently accept Your answer to my prayers, whether it be yes, no or wait. All I ask I place before You in Jesus’ name. Amen. God, the Holy Spirit, help us to be models of good deeds in every respect by being temperate, dignified, self-controlled and sound in faith, love and charity. May we control our temper and hold our tongue, especially when we grow impatient and are in pain. May we be like Saint John Paul II who was an outstanding model of self-control, dignity and unwavering faith. Amen. Conclude with the Our Father, Hail Mary, and Glory Be prayers.",

Conclude with the Our Father, Hail Mary, and Glory Be prayers. Day 6 Dear Saint John Paul, you preached: “Love your families. Teach them the dignity of life. Teach them the ways of harmony and peace. Teach them the value of faith and prayer and goodness! Help transform the world around you by giving the best of yourselves in the service of others and your country.” Just as Christ taught us, you preached and live the Golden Rule: “Do unto others as you would have them do to you.” How simple it is to hear this, but how incredibly difficult, at times, to do this. Be with me, and help me see God in my neighbor and in all those I find difficult to love or accept. Dear Lord, throughout my lifetime, I have been taught to be a good person and to be a blessing to others. To be good is not just to follow the rules, but more so, to follow You and obey Your commandments. May I bring harmony and peace to others, and spread Your good news to my family, my friends, my community and my country. Saint John Paul II made Your goodness known throughout the world by welcoming and embracing everyone who sought Your presence, regardless of age, gender or creed. Through Your goodness and mercy, we will receive the healing we seek through the intercession of Saint John Paul II. Amen. Conclude with the Our Father, Hail Mary, and Glory Be prayers. Day 7 Dear Saint John Paul, you preached: “The goal and target of our life is He, the Christ who awaits us – each one singly and all together – to lead us across the boundaries of time to the eternal embrace of the God who loves us.” Help me, dear Saint John Paul, to remember that life with God is the highest and greatest of all goals. In every moment of my life, help me to be focused on my relationship with Christ, so that when my earthly journey ends, my eternal life with Jesus will begin. God the Father, in humility we offer our lives to You in the service of others. May we be like Saint John Paul II in proclaiming our faith and trust in You, so we will be blessed and can fulfill our Christian vocation. It is through our weakness and illness that You have touched our lives, and we now seek Your goodness and mercy to be healed. Amen. Conclude with the Our Father, Hail Mary, and Glory Be prayers. Day 8 Dear Saint John Paul, you preached: “People are made for happiness. Rightly, then, you thirst for happiness. Christ has the answer to this desire of yours. But He asks you to trust Him. True joy is a victory, something which cannot be obtained without a long and difficult struggle. Christ holds the secret of this victory. . . In order to sing God’s praises we must re-learn the language of humility and trust, the language of moral integrity and of sincere commitment to all that is truly good in the sight of the Lord.” Once again, in simple words, you teach us that nothing is more important than life with Christ. Lord, Jesus Christ, grant me the gift of a humble heart so that I can respond to Your call to take up the Cross and follow You each day as Your disciple. I will strive to preserve the unity in my household through my actions of peace and understanding. Through the intercession of Saint John Paul II, please grant me the gift of healing that I earnestly implore. Amen. Conclude with the Our Father, Hail Mary, and Glory Be prayers. Day 9 Dear Saint John Paul, the surest, straightest road to Christ is through His Holy Mother. When I am lost and confused in life, lead me to place myself before Our Blessed Mother, asking her to rescue me to faithfully live the spiritual path that leads to her Divine Son. Teach me to have in my heart the same great love you had for our Blessed Mother. Dear Lord, You are the Greatest Healer. Everything I have comes from You: my life, my health, my family, my friends, my possessions and all that truly matters. I surrender them all to You as I search for meaning and purpose in all that is happening to me. I claim complete healing of my mind, body, heart and soul. I claim healing for those who are suffering and are lost. I claim healing for my family. I claim financial blessings so I can be a blessing to others. Grant me the patience to confidently accept Your answer to my prayers, whether it be yes, no or wait. All I ask I place before You in Jesus’ name. Amen. God, the Holy Spirit, help us to be models of good deeds in every respect by being temperate, dignified, self-controlled and sound in faith, love and charity. May we control our temper and hold our tongue, especially when we grow impatient and are in pain. May we be like Saint John Paul II who was an outstanding model of self-control, dignity and unwavering faith. Amen. Conclude with the Our Father, Hail Mary, and Glory Be prayers.",

Through his heavenly intercession, please grant the following petition(s) . . . Here state your request(s). Grant also that I may grow in love for You and proclaim boldly the love of Jesus Christ to all people. Through Christ, Our Lord. Amen. Day 1 Dear Saint John Paul, you preached: “The future starts today, not tomorrow.” As I start these nine days of prayer with you, I thank you for reminding me that with God’s help, I can begin again, but I need to start now, not at some distant point in the future. Your words are encouraging and inspiring to me. Please be with me as I progress through these nine days of prayer with you. Dear Lord, You are the greatest Healer. You gave Saint John Paul II to the entire world to show us how much You love us. With Your mighty power and through his intercession, we seek healing, not just of our physical body but our emotional, mental, social and spiritual health as well. In keeping with Your greatest commandment, we will love You with all our heart, with all our mind, with all our soul and with all our strength. We will also love our neighbor as we love ourselves. Amen. Conclude with the Our Father, Hail Mary, and Glory Be prayers. Day 2 Dear Saint John Paul, you preached: “I plead with you, never, ever give up on hope. Never doubt, never tire, and never become discouraged. Be not afraid.” With your help, I will not give up hope. I will be trusting, confident, persistent and unafraid in prayer. God, our Father, grant us the peace we seek when confronted with different obstacles each day. Guide us so we won’t falter in our steps. May peace always reign in our hearts even if there is fear that we might fall flat on our face. We will not be anxious, but will have faith that is unwavering like that of Saint John Paul II. We will do whatever is true, honorable, just, pure, lovely and gracious in Your eyes, so that Your peace may abide in our hearts always. Amen. Conclude with the Our Father, Hail Mary, and Glory Be prayers. Day 3 Dear Saint John Paul, you preached: “Have no fear of moving into the unknown. Simply step out fearlessly knowing that I am with you and therefore no harm can befall you. All is very, very well. Do this in complete faith and confidence.” What more can I say, but thank you for your confidence in me. Help me to have complete faith in God. Stand with me at all times as my intercessor and spiritual guide until I attain the great treasure of Heaven. Dear Jesus, Son of the living God, we rejoice because we believe that through the intercession of Saint John Paul II, our healing is near at hand. We are joyful in our ways and our speech for we know that You will always comfort us as a mother comforts her children. We thank you for the joy You’ve given us when You were born into our world, because You became one of us in all things but sin. You endured tremendous suffering for our sake, so that we will be saved from our sins. Turn our mourning into rejoicing because of Your resurrection from the dead. Amen. Conclude with the Our Father, Hail Mary, and Glory Be prayers. Day 4 Dear Saint John Paul, just like St. Paul the Apostle who described his journey as a race, you tell me that life with Jesus is a wonderful adventure. Life is not a sprint for me, but rather a winding marathon with its curves and its ups and downs. Help me by being with me at all times as I struggle in this race toward the fullness of life in Christ. God the Holy Spirit, grant us wisdom and knowledge as we wait patiently for the healing You promised. May our families be blessed with patience in helping us cope with illness and other problems. During his lifetime, Saint John Paul was a living testimony of how much God loves us through his patience in dealing with every religious or political leader around the world, as well as with the severe sicknesses that afflicted him. We believe that as long as love reigns in our hearts each day, we will be healed, for “Love is patient and kind.” Amen. Conclude with the Our Father, Hail Mary, and Glory Be prayers. Day 5  Dear Saint John Paul, you preached: “Do not abandon yourselves to despair. We are the Easter people and Hallelujah is our song.” Help me to be joyful in this wonderful adventure of life. Help me always to have true Christian joy in my heart, mind and spirit. Help me always to be faithful to the Will of God in my life. Through God’s loving grace and kindness, we have been blessed with the great kindness shown by the people who take care of us, like our family, friends, relatives, caregivers, physicians, rehabilitation specialists, nutritionists and spiritual advisers. Saint John Paul II manifested incredible love, kindness and forgiveness to the man who tried to assassinate him. We believe that we will be healed if we forgive those who have wronged us, and if we extend a helping hand to our least sisters and brothers living in distress, poverty and need. Amen.

Day 8 Dear Saint John Paul, you preached: “People are made for happiness. Rightly, then, you thirst for happiness. Christ has the answer to this desire of yours. But He asks you to trust Him. True joy is a victory, something which cannot be obtained without a long and difficult struggle. Christ holds the secret of this victory. . . In order to sing God’s praises we must re-learn the language of humility and trust, the language of moral integrity and of sincere commitment to all that is truly good in the sight of the Lord.” Once again, in simple words, you teach us that nothing is more important than life with Christ. Lord, Jesus Christ, grant me the gift of a humble heart so that I can respond to Your call to take up the Cross and follow You each day as Your disciple. I will strive to preserve the unity in my household through my actions of peace and understanding. Through the intercession of Saint John Paul II, please grant me the gift of healing that I earnestly implore. Amen. Conclude with the Our Father, Hail Mary, and Glory Be prayers. Day 9 Dear Saint John Paul, the surest, straightest road to Christ is through His Holy Mother. When I am lost and confused in life, lead me to place myself before Our Blessed Mother, asking her to rescue me to faithfully live the spiritual path that leads to her Divine Son. Teach me to have in my heart the same great love you had for our Blessed Mother. Dear Lord, You are the Greatest Healer. Everything I have comes from You: my life, my health, my family, my friends, my possessions and all that truly matters. I surrender them all to You as I search for meaning and purpose in all that is happening to me. I claim complete healing of my mind, body, heart and soul. I claim healing for those who are suffering and are lost. I claim healing for my family. I claim financial blessings so I can be a blessing to others. Grant me the patience to confidently accept Your answer to my prayers, whether it be yes, no or wait. All I ask I place before You in Jesus’ name. Amen. God, the Holy Spirit, help us to be models of good deeds in every respect by being temperate, dignified, self-controlled and sound in faith, love and charity. May we control our temper and hold our tongue, especially when we grow impatient and are in pain. May we be like Saint John Paul II who was an outstanding model of self-control, dignity and unwavering faith. Amen. Conclude with the Our Father, Hail Mary, and Glory Be prayers.",

        "quote": "While very little is known today about the lives of these holy men, Marcellinus and Peter were prominent enough in the early Church to be included amongst the saints of the Roman Canon and their names continue to be mentioned during celebration of the Eucharist.   Further evidence of the veneration and respect of the Church lives on in the basilica that Emperor Constantine built over their tombs in Rome. The story of the lives and martyrdom of Marcellinus and Peter was recorded by Pope Saint Damasus, who learned of their heroic acts directly from their executioner—a man who converted to Christianity shortly after their deaths.  According to the saintly pope, the executioner was deeply troubled following his role in the martyrdom and could not shake the feeling that a faith that had given Marcellinus and Peter such peace of mind and steady joy in the face of death must be authentic. Marcellinus was a priest and Peter was an exorcist (authorised by the Church to work against demonic possession in individuals) who worked alongside him.   Imprisoned during the persecution of Christians under the reign of Diocletian, Marcellinus and Peter embraced their suffering, seeing it as an opportunity for evangelisation and quickly had converted the majority of prisoners in jail with them—including the jailor and his entire family.   This was accomplished when Peter set the daughter of the jailer free from an evil spirit which possessed her.   Shortly thereafter, the jailor, his wife and their other children were baptised into the faith—right in the cell of Peter and Marcellinus. When Diocletian heard of their activities, he was greatly incensed and had them tortured, stripped naked and thrown into cells filled with only broken shards of glass. When it was observed that this only served to increase their faith and joy in suffering, he had them taken to the forest of Silva Nigra and dig their own graves.   Then, he had them beheaded in the forest, so that other Christians would not find their bodies, bury them properly, and then subsequently venerate them.   However, that was not to be the case. Shortly following their death, a Christian matron by the name of Lucilla learned of their martyrdom through a dream (or possibly a prophetic vision) and came with some fellow faithful to the gravesite.   The relics of the holy martyrs were removed and translated to a more proper burial place, a set of catacombs in Rome.   When Christianity was restored as a “legal” faith tradition under Constantine, he had a great basilica built in their honour over their tomb.",
        "prayer": "O Holy Apostle, you are the Rock upon which Almighty God has built His Church. Obtain for me I pray you: lively faith, firm hope, and burning love, complete detachment from myself, contempt of the world, patience in adversity, humility in prosperity, recollection in prayer, purity of heart, a right intention in all my works, diligence in fulfilling the duties of my state of life, constancy in my resolutions, resignation to the will of God and perseverance in the grace of God even unto death; that so, by means of your intercession and your glorious merits, I may be made worthy to appear before the Chief and Eternal Shepherd of Souls, Jesus Christ, Who with the Father and the Holy Spirit, lives and reigns forever. Amen.",

However, when King William the Conqueror came to the English throne she and her family were forced to flee the country and their ship wrecked off the coast of Scotland. King Malcolm of Scotland welcomed the exiles and fell in love with Margaret. Malcolm and Margaret were married in 1070. Though Malcolm was a good man, he was rough and uncultured like his country. Margaret helped Malcolm and his court to develop better manners and to become more virtuous. Margaret helped her husband, lived an austere life, encouraged the arts and education in her country, took care of all the domestic affairs in her household, and much more. She lived a very virtuous life. She and her husband had 6 sons and 2 daughters together. The youngest boy even became a saint (St. David).

She is honored by being the first person Christ appeared to after His Resurrection. Each of us has sin in our lives. Whatever that sin is, we can turn to Jesus as Mary Magdalene did… with sincere sorrow… and become true disciples of Jesus. Only if we confide in Jesus in our sorrow and our joy can we truly call Jesus our ‘friend’. Mary Magdalene reported seeing Jesus after the resurrection  by exclaiming to the other followers… “I have seen the Lord!”",

O' blessed St Paul of the Cross, turning towards you now I ask that from your place with Jesus and Mary in heaven that you may look mercifully upon my poor soul and hear my prayers, and with all of your love humbly present them to Jesus for me (mention petitions). Obtain for me also a great love of Jesus suffering, that by frequent meditation on His Passion I may take up my own cross and accept with holy resignation the sufferings that God has permitted in my life. Help me to suffer and to sacrifice in union with Jesus for the conversion of my poor soul, the souls of my loved ones, and for all of humanity. Help me to love Jesus and Mary with all of my heart, and intercede for me that I may, by the grace of God, die a holy death, and come at last to enjoy with you the blessed Presence of Jesus and Mary in Heaven for all of eternity. One Our Father, Hail Mary, Glory be.... I ask this in the Name of Jesus Christ our Lord, AMEN",

Through his prayer help us to see the true dignity of the human family, all children of one father and to spend ourselves for their salvation. We ask this through Our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son, who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God for ever and ever. Amen. Dear saint of our modern times, you were permeated with compassion for the oppressed, for human beings sold as slaves. While alleviating their natural ills, you also took away their spiritual ills, and taught them the surpassing knowledge of Christ. Inspire many of our contemporaries to become self-sacrificing missionaries like you. Amen.",

You understand how difficult it is to function after a sleepless night, how hard it is to be kind, understanding and loving when you are exhausted, how frustrating it is to be tired and unable to do your best. Please intercede for (name person) before the throne of God and ask that if it be God’s will that (name person) be able to rest peacefully at night and no longer suffer with insomnia.   If it is not God’s will at this time I ask for (name person) to have the grace to use any sleepless hours as a time of prayer, offering that sleeplessness for the souls who most need God’s love and mercy.   St. Peter Damian, thank you for your prayers.   Amen.",

        "quote": "The feast day of St. Wenceslas is celebrated on September 28.  He is most remembered for the Christmas Carol Good King Wenceslas.  He became King of Bohemia at the age of 18. King Wenceslaus was born to the Duke of Bohemia.  His family had been converted by St. Cyril and St. Methodius.  His mother however, was a pagan.  After her husbands death she persecuted Christians. The Duchess Ludmilla was the mother in law of Drahomira and grandmother to Wenceslaus.  She taught him about religion.  He practiced his faith and received the sacraments in secret. When he became King of Bohemia the persecution ended.  He built churches, recalled priests from exile and welcomed Christian missionaries into Bohemia. St. Wenceslaus had a strong devotion to the Eucharist and helped prepare the altar bread with his own hands.  He also made wine from wheat and grapes he grew himself. A reconciliation was attempted with his family when they gathered at a banquet on the Feast of St. Cosmas and Damien (Sept. 27).  The next morning his brother killed him with a lance on the steps of the church.  Two years before, his mother had arranged for his grandmother Ludmilla to be strangled to death. The feast day of St. Ludmilla is celebrated on September 16. The good king died at the age of 22.  Miracles were reported at his tomb. The Christmas Carol sung about Gook King Wenceslaus  reminds us to serve others as the good King did.  To think less of ourselves and to see Christ in the poor.",
        "prayer": "O God, who taught the Martyr Saint Wenceslas to place the heavenly Kingdom before an earthly one, grant through his prayers that, denying ourselves, we may hold fast to you with all our heart. Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son, who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit, one God, for ever and ever.",
